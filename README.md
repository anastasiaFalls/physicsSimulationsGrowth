# <u>physicsSimulationsGrowth<u>    <3
A personal exploration into the development and evolution of computerized physics simulations from 2018-2024. 


This is an ongoing personal project that I will contribute to over the course of Feburary-However long it takes, this research project is aimed at being very extensive. 


# *What is being explored*

The evolution of computerized physical simulations in recent years, with a focus on the specific variables that contributed to the exponential growth in the simulation's efficiency and realism. 


# *How the data is going to be used*

Used to refine my own simulations but also explore the profound ramifications of these developments in contrast to the beginning of the time period explored, from both a developer and engineering standpoint as well as a socilogical aspect.
