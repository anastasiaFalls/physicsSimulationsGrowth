# physicsSimulationsGrowth
A personal exploration into the development and evolution of computerized physics simulations from 2018-2024. 


# What is being explored 

The evolution of computerized physical simulations in recent years, with a focus on the specific variables that contributed to the exponential growth in the simulation's efficiency and realism. 


# How the data going to be used

Used to refine my own simulations but also explore the profound ramifications of these developments in contrast to the beginning of the time period explored, from both a developer and engineering standpoint as well as a social aspect.
